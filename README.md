# Zillow Project 2017 Edition 

# Project Description
This project was created to predict single family housing prices by using features from the 2017 Zillow dataset and regression machine learning models. 


# Project Goal
Discover features that correlate with property value
Use features to develop a machine learning model to predict property value

# Initial hypothesis
The initial hypothesis is that property value is most correlated with square footage, number of total rooms, and number of bathrooms. Additionally, lower correlation relationships will reduce the overall effectiveness of the regression models. 

# Plan
## Wrangle the data
## Explore data for features that correlate with property value
### Answer the following initial question:
What features correlate with home value?
### Then answer:
Is there a correlation between area and property value?
Is there a correlation between bedrooms and property value?
Is there a correlation between bathrooms and property value?
Is there a correlation between total_rooms and property value?
## Develop a model to predict property value
Use the features that correlate with property value to run different regression models picking the best one to test

## Draw conclusions

# Note on running the notebook:
To run the notebook simply run each block separately or all at once make sure your env file has the right save credentials or the notebook will not run
